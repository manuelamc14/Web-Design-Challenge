# Visualization Dashboard 

This project intends to create a visualization dashboard website using visualizations of weather data. 

It comprehends a landing page with a short description of the project intended to share and quick access to each visualization page. There is a description of the chart area and a hint of its behavior. Also, a comparison page was included, where the four visualizations are displayed to make the comparison more straightforward. To finish, the data used to plot this chart was included on a different page. 

The dashboard incorporates a navigation bar, which makes more comfortable the navigation through the website.
